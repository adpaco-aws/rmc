# RMC Dashboard

The [RMC Dashboard](./dashboard/index.html) purpose is to show the level of support in RMC for all Rust features.
To this end, we extract all examples from the following books:
 * The Rust Reference
 * The Rustonomicon
 * The Rust Unstable Book
 * Rust by Example

Then we run these examples through RMC and collect their outputs.
A summary of these outputs is displayed in the [RMC Dashboard](./dashboard/index.html)
